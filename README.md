# ShowWinCursorLocation
Creates a simple window that follows the mouse cursor.

## About
The target audience for this program are content creators that want to record
video game play while hiding the game cursor so that the content shows better in
trailers and shorts. This application enables the player to see where the mouse
cursor is despite the cursor not rendering in the game.

To use this program effectively, the video recording application must be recording
the game window, not the display window.

## Usage
The program is a console app with no command-line parameters. Build and run the
program and a small white window will appear to follow the mouse cursor.
